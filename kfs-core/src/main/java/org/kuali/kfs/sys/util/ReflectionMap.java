/**
 * A Map implementation which wraps a Java bean and can return values from that based on property Strings.  Unlike Apache Common's BeanMap, this Map can handle nested properties - though for the sake of that power,
 * the Map makes no effort to know its Set of keys at all - since to figure all of that out, it would need to recurse down and avoid property cycles, etc.  It does not know how many Entries it has.  Furthermore,
 * one cannot put any values into the Map and expect the underlying bean to have their own values changed.  It's really a read-only way to read nested properties from the underlying object via Map semantics.
