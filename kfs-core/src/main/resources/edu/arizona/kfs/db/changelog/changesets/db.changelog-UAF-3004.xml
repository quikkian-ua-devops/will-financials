    UAF-3004
        These changesets will create three new columns on the GL Entry table (GLE),
    including a new object id for Rice to work with, a new GUID for each entry, and
    a new GEC document number column. Further, these new columns will get appropriate
    constraints and indexes added. Next, a new GEC Entry Relationship table is
    created, then records added for existing GEC Doc -> Accounting Line -> GL Entry
    relationships, with a minimal column count. The GEC Relationship table will similarly
    have its own constraints/indexes/composite-PK applied.

    There's several non-standard things going on here, so I'll point them out now:
        1. We need to disable a BI trigger on the GLE table, since otherwise, each of
    the 78MM records would update BI's reporting view, twice. Since we are not changing
    financial information, and the new columns would not be in BI reports anyway, there
    is no conflict in disabling the trigger for the duration of these changesets.
        2. The new GLE sequence is based on the highest ID that's generated after the fact.
    We don't really care if the sequence is interupted, it just turns out to be a nice
    way of doing things, since this will work no matter the intial data set. To do it though,
    we use PL/SQL, and the oracle built-in "ROWNUM". Liquibase has mechanisms to allow this,
    but it does mean this script is RDBMS-specific to oracle.
        3. These changesets represent large operations on 78MM+ rows -first updating, then
    rolling back- I wanted to avoid spending cycles where we could. Since the main rollbacks
    include dropping either columns or tables, then we really don't care about rolling back
    the intermediate updates, constraints, or indexes; these will implicitly be deleted
    when either a column is dropped, or the entire table is dropped. So to save time
    and redo-log space, I stub-out several intermediate rollbacks with a no-op, which
    tricks liquibase into thinking a particular rollback was performed and completed. The
    end result is that the involved GLE table is restored to its original state, and all
    other objects get deleted, either explicitly or implicitly so.
        4. Note that rollbacks are executed in reverse order of each changeset's operations.
    For insance, all 11 changesets' main SQL block is executed sequentially, and then each
    rollback is applied in reverse sequence, 11 to 0.
    Knowing this should make it clear why and where I decided to stub-out the rollbacks.

            Remove the duplicate relationships in the new GEC Relationship table; these relate to the GLEs we stamped
            as "LOCKED" in the last step. As a historical note, when this was created, the FY16/17 produced 94 bad
            records. Lastly, this allows us to remain key-constrained across the lines/gle tables for the next step
            (marking the good relationships).

                an oracle specific join for update, which is the only valid syntax that oracle accepts
                for a join within an update clause. Also, since we are not setting an FK relationship
                here (don't want any overhead from checking the constraint), this method ensures there
                is a 1:1 Entry ID relationship between the tables (ie, both tables are key-constrained).
